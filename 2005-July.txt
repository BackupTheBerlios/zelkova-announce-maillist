Subject: [Zelkova-announce] Welcome to the zelkova-announce mailing list.
Message-ID: <20050721133940.GA11777@dongsu.pe.kr>

Welcome to the zelkova-announce mailing list.
This list will announce important newses about the Zelkova project, such as
official release, development changes and development status.

Zelkova a firewall with capabilities of Intrusion Prevention System. It is
based on Linux kernel, but does not use the traditional netfilter packet
filter firewall. Instead it contructs a new framework which is totally
different from anything ever seen. It will be implemented with the FIS(Fat
Inverted Segment) Tree model, which processes high traffics in a significantly
fast speed. It will also include application-layer filtering capabilities such
as pattern matching, protocol matchers, protocol anomaly detectors, and so on.
Of course the core of these modules is a pattern matching module, and I will
implement this module with modern effective pattern matching algorithms such
as Boyer-Moore and Aho-Corasick.

Thank you.
